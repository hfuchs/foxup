foxup - Client-Driven Backupâ„¢
================================

2012-03-11, by Hagen Fuchs <code@hfuchs.net>

Motivation / Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------

So what's foxup?  A backup solution that in|sub|perverts the usual
hierarchy of backup systems in order to be actually useful.  Of course,
Foxup is [also] a hamlet in the Yorkshire Dales in the Craven district
of North Yorkshire, England near Halton Gill and Litton.[0]

Anyways.  Here's how traditional Linux small-scale (aka personal) backup
software looks like to me:

  0. They are not small-scale at all (this hits home with most, but
     bacula and amanda are pretty good paragons of this).

  1. They look really juicy and really right about perfect (say
     rsnapshot) until you realize they aren't at all (in rsnapshot's
     case: it expects the machine to be up at 3.  In the morning.)

  2. They throw a web interface into the deal.  Great!  Thanks!  Bye!
     (BackupPC)

So, I'm looking for a usable rsnapshot.  Srsly, I'm a /huge/ rsync
admirer -- Andrew Tridgell and Paul Mackerras are adorable people.
I adore 'em.  Oookay.  Moving on.  Backup.  Small-scale.  rsync.

TODO Actually say sth about the damn implementation!


Alternatives
------------------------------------------------------------

*rsnapshot*.
Gets started by cron at night to do daily, weekly and monthly backups.
Nice.  Excpet of course, when your machine isn't online at night.  Take
a look at <http://bugs.debian.org/523923> for a bit of hilarity (Clever
dude develops anacron-friendly script (in Ruby, sadly), maintainer: no
need, we have cron.d-job).


Complete Rewrite for Github-Glory
------------------------------------------------------------

2012-03-12, Till now, I simply abused the init.d-script for rsync on the
server-side.  That's not a clean option (well, it could be, if there
were something like a /etc/rsyncd.d ...).  So, for the server, I simply
steal this init script and reappropriate it for the masses (ie: change
the port number).  The client needs little change, but I thought it
a cool idea to introduce a pre_backup.d directory where currently only
the wakeonlan-portition of the original script resides.  Possibilities
boggle the mind.

I even went out of my way and -- *gasp* -- created a Makefile for a fully
automated package build process!  I hear Sinatra singing just outside my
window.  It's heavenly.


TODO
------------------------------------------------------------

  + Server: date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M"
  + Server: probably want to get rid of halt_on_idle some time in the
    future.  Optional script burried somewhere in /usr/share/?

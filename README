foxup - Client-Driven Backupâ„¢
================================

2012-03-11, by Hagen Fuchs <code@hfuchs.net>

Motivation / Introduction
-----------------------------

So what's foxup?  A backup solution that in|sub|perverts the usual
hierarchy of backup systems in order to be actually useful.  Of course,
Foxup is [also] a hamlet in the Yorkshire Dales in the Craven district
of North Yorkshire, England near Halton Gill and Litton.[0]

Anyways.  Here's how traditional small-scale backup software works:

  1. There's a backup server that regularly takes backups of client
     machines.

(TODO example!  bacula?


Alternatives
-----------------------------

*rsnapshot*.
Gets started by cron at night to do daily, weekly and monthly backups.
Nice.  Excpet of course, when your machine isn't online at night.  Take
a look at <http://bugs.debian.org/523923> for a bit of hilarity (Clever
dude develops anacron-friendly script (in Ruby, sadly), maintainer: no
need, we have cron.d-job).

    Memo to myself: Consult Google on even the most obscure project
    names and portemanteaus.

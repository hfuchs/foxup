Description: Simple backup scripts well suited to desktop or mobile systems.
 This is the client side of the ultra light-weight foxup backup
 solution.  It comes with a suitable back-it-al-up config.  You'll have
 to have a foxup-server running somewhere (preferably somewhere remote,
 but localhost will do).
 .
 Think of it as an rsnapshot that's usable by machines that aren't
 always online.
